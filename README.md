# 30ProjectsOfSwift
This repository is created for practicing swift.

## Hi,me.

I am omni_Hsin, an Chinese developer and currently learning Swift. I've been thinking of running a Github account for like one year, not until I read [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) project on Medium, I finally decided to do so.

This project was totally inspired by Sam Lu's project.
